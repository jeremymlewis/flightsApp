# Flights App
This app uses a flights api to show you which cities are the cheapest to fly to in the US on any given date.

This project was built for my CS260 Web Programming class, we were asked to create an app that used 3rd-party apis to fetch data.

While this was a good way to learn about using web apis, my api liscence has expired and the live site has almost no functionality because of that.  No future maintenance is expected to address this.
